                <h5>2009</h5>
                <img src="images/Studio_Close.JPG" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Cinque Terre" width="204" height="136">
                <p>There is not much yet!</p>
                <p>
                    It dawned on me that I had always wanted to get back into the music
                    and the recording industry and the timing was perfect as I had fewer financial responsibilities.
                    I finally got up enough nerve and money to purchase my first synthesizer workstation.
                    I waited until I got a check from the government in the form of a tax return and headed out to Sam Ash
                    music store and bought a <a href="https://www.yamaha-keyboard-guide.com/yamaha-motif-es8.html">Yamaha Motif ES8</a>,
                    a dynamic microphone, and a pair of <a href="http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/studio-monitors/resolv/resolv50a/">Sanson 50a</a>
                    active monitors with subwoofer.
                    Enough power and capabilities to start recording some pretty decent beats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following year I purchased a more powerful computer, a
                    <a href="https://www.roland.com/us/products/vs-2000cd/">Roland VS2000</a> 16 track audio recorder,
                    a couple of expansion cards and software, a flat screen monitor, and a
                    <a href="https://www.roland.com/us/products/varios/">Roland VariOS</a> Open System Module
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, I've added more equipment but finally decided to invest in a software based digital
                    audio workstation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">(DAW)</a> instead. I did a lot of research and comparison shopping and chose
                    <a href="https://www.avid.com/pro-tools">Digidesign Pro Tools LE</a> (now Avid),
                    <a href="https://www.reasonstudios.com/en/reason">Propellerhead Reason</a>, and
                    <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/">Ableton Live</a>. I also selected
                    <a href="https://www.native-instruments.com/en/">Native Instrument</a>
                    Kore (no longer avaiable), Kontakt, and Komplete as my main VSTIs because they comes
                    with an abundance of soft instruments and samplers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each year I would plan on a new purchase using my tax return as the primary source of the capital
                    investment. So as the years passed, I purchased a
                    <a href="https://mackie.com/en/products/controllers/mcu-pro-and-xt-pro">Mackie Universal Control</a>
                    (MCU Pro) and 2 extenders (XT Pro), a couple more flat screens, 3 desks, condenser microphones, a pair of
                    <a href="https://www.dynaudio.com/professional-audio/classic-bm-range/bm15a/">Dynaudio B15a</a>, and monitor stands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I finally decided it was time for room acoustic treatment. So I did a lot more
                    research and comparison and selected <a href="https://www.gikacoustics.com/">GIK acoustic panels</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a small up and coming company partnering with others, IKP is working to construct the best project
                    studio we could. We are finally a couple of days from completing it. With all the latest software and
                    some great hardware equipment, we hope to be a competitive force in the project studio recording business.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">It's Complete</h2>
                <h5>2012</h5>
                <img src="images/Studio_Wide.JPG" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Cinque Terre" width="204" height="136">
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    I finally put up the acoustic room treatment and what a difference. The sound is fantastic.
                    I have never heard my music sound so good. The frequency response is flat at the low, mid and high
                    end of the frequency spectrum. The true test will come when I bounce some tracks down to CD and play
                    them in the trusty car. If they play well in the car and on my home hi-fi system, it will mean that
                    the room's acoustics and monitor system are translating very well..
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will soon start uploading some of my songs to the web. I have created a Soundclick, and Soundcloud account.
                    These are some web site that stream audio from the web so that you don't have to download anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My clients now have a space where they are comfortable tracking their material and know that the music
                    they produce will sound as good on other systems as it does in my project studio. Now I can concentrate
                    on making great beats and tracks rather than trying to process the sound based on misinformation that the
                    room was creating before.
