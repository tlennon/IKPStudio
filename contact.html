                <span class="reviewer">Julie... </span>I wanted to create a demo
                to upload it one of those cloud composer services so my friends and family can hear me sing.
                I had no idea whet the music should sound like other than what was in my head. IKP recorded
                my vocals on a track and when I returned, they produced a beat that matched perfectly.
                They even overdubbed my vocals and created harmony backing tracks with my own voice.
                They tuned everything so that I sounded perfect. It was AMAZING and
                my freinds say I should submit the track to a record compnay. WOW!...
